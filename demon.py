"""
Python implementation of the DEMON algorithm for estimating the
envelope of an amplitude modulated noise. Two versions are given,
the square law and hilbert transform DEMON algorithms. Depending 
on the use case either algorithm may be more desirable. Both expect
an input array of the original data, and filter parameters. Both
return an output array containing the estimated envelope of the 
input data.
